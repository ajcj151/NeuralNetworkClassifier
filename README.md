# NeuralNetworkClassifier
The GTK-based no-programming-required simple neural network classifier software for Win/Unix/Linux/OSX platforms

**About Page**

NeuralNetworkClassifier uses a simple 3-layer artificial neural network architecture. It is not deep and may not qualify as Deep Learning but it can perform multi-category classification tasks on small to medium-sized data sets.

**Data Page**

Training and Test sets from a csv/text file can be loaded provided you indicate the correct delimiter. Some network parameters are guessed but you can modify it.

**Training Page**

This is where the actual artificial neural network training happens. You can freely start/stop/continue the training process. Training is performed during idle mode so you can freely move between pages.

**Network Page**

Finally, trained network parameters can be saved and loaded for use in future classification tasks or to provide a better starting point for training.
